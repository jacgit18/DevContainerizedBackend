Good morning Zephyr,

I hope you're doing well. My name is Joshua, and I'm currently working as a QA tester. Although we haven't officially met, we share a mutual connection with Johannes Naylor, who spoke very highly of you and suggested I reach out.

I'd love to take the opportunity to have a virtual coffee chat and learn more about your software engineering journey. I'd also appreciate any advice you might have for someone in my position and how I can contribute more effectively during my time here. If you have some time available this week or next, I'd be grateful to connect.

Looking forward to hearing from you.




Hi [Recruiter’s Name], I’m currently working as a contractor on [Team/Project], and I’ve really enjoyed the experience so far. I’m very interested in exploring the possibility of converting to a full-time role and would love to discuss any opportunities that may be available. Could we set up a time to talk?
