Good afternoon Sangay hope your doing well, we havent offically meet before, but im currently contracting as QA engineer, and Iâ€™ve really enjoyed the experience so far. I'm interested in exploring the possibility of transitioning to a full-time role and would love to discuss any opportunities that might be available.

Would you be open to meeting this week or next to discuss this further?

I look forward to hearing from you.
