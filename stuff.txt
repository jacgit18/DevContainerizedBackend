Hi Mercelis, thanks for getting back to me and for the clarification. I appreciate your offer to discuss the overall process. I'll keep an eye on external roles that open up, but in the meantime, it would be great to learn more about how the hiring process works here, especially any insights you might have from your experience with external hiring. Let me know a good time for us to chat. Thank you again.
